## 🚀 Setup & Run Instructions

Follow these simple steps to run the frontend application locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or above recommended) installed, and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` into a local configuration and set up any custom parameters:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Launch Development Server
Launch the Vite development workspace:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will launch on port **3000** automatically (or port **5173** during vanilla local development).

## 📡 Backend API & Proxy Configuration

To prevent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) blocks, Vite is configured with a built-in reverse proxy forwarding:
- REST queries from `/api` to the FastAPI backend origin (`http://localhost:8000`).
- Real-time updates from `/ws` via secure WebSockets.

Refer to `vite.config.ts` for exact settings:
```ts
server: {
  port: 3000,
  host: "0.0.0.0",
  proxy: {
    '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:8000', changeOrigin: true },
    '/ws':  { target: 'ws://localhost:8000', ws: true },
  },
}
```

## 🎯 Guest Bypass Mode (Demo / Admin Bypasses)

For rapid evaluations or if the backend servers are unavailable, the application contains a fully featured offline sandbox mode.
- Log in using `demo` or `admin` as the School21 username on the login screen.
- This triggers our Custom Axios Adapter (offline sandbox) built within `src/lib/axios.ts` to seamlessly populate mock data representing dashboards, active slot countdowns, user achievements, leaderboard logs, and notifications.
